# Dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles repository. I use it to store my dotfiles, which are
mostly shell scripts and configuration files.

## Installation

The dotfiles are propagated using [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximilienGilet/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
stow .
```

## License

The dotfiles are licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE).
